## Key Findings

### âœ… Strengths

1. **Dynamic Agent Discovery**: Automatic registration via `pkgutil` and `inspect`
2. **Async Orchestration**: Well-implemented `MasterAgent` with timeouts and metrics
3. **Security Mechanisms**: Redaction (2 levels), policy enforcement, no hardcoded secrets
4. **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks (ruff, black, mypy), â‰¥85% test coverage
5. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns, extensible plugin system

### ðŸ”§ Recommendations (Priority: High â†’ Low)

#### High Priority

1. Add comprehensive docstrings to all public methods â€” Done (2025â€‘10â€‘22)
2. Complete type hints coverage (some utility functions missing) â€” Done (2025â€‘10â€‘22)
3. Improve error message specificity â€” Done (2025â€‘10â€‘22)

#### Medium Priority

4. Increase debug logging in critical paths â€” Done (2025-10-22)
5. Expand test coverage for complex orchestration scenarios â€” Done (2025-10-22)
6. Create architecture diagrams â€” Done (2025-10-22)

#### Low Priority

7. Profile performance with many agents
8. Add optional metrics export (Prometheus)
9. Consider i18n for CLI messages

#### Update 2025-10-22

- High priority items (docstrings, type hints, error messages) have been implemented.
- Additional debug logging and orchestration regression tests were added alongside new architecture diagrams.

## Checklists

### Functionality âœ…

- [x] Code does what it's supposed to do
- [x] Edge cases are handled
- [x] Error handling is appropriate
- [x] No obvious bugs or logic errors

### Code Quality âœ…

- [x] Code is readable and well-structured
- [x] Functions are small and focused
- [x] Variable names are descriptive
- [x] No significant code duplication
- [x] Follows project conventions

### Security âœ…

- [x] No obvious security vulnerabilities
- [x] Input validation is present
- [x] Sensitive data is handled properly
- [x] No hardcoded secrets

---

## Security Highlights

### Input Validation

- CLI arguments validated by Typer
- Agent configs validated by Pydantic
- Layered config system (file â†’ env â†’ CLI)

### Data Redaction

**Normal Level:**

- API keys, emails

**Strict Level:**

- Bearer tokens, AWS keys, IPv4, credit cards
- Polish IBAN, PESEL, NIP

### Security Policy

- Agent allowlists via `FTSYSTEM_ALLOWED_AGENTS`
- Round limits via `FTSYSTEM_MAX_ROUNDS`
- Environment-based configuration

---

## Next Steps

1. Benchmark orchestration performance under production-scale agent loads.
2. Integrate Prometheus metrics output with the target monitoring stack.
3. Consider security audit before production deployment.
4. Monitor test coverage as new features are added.
