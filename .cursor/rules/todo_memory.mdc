# TODO and memory orchestration

## Context

The file `D:\projekty AI\ftSystem\.cursor‑tasks.md` is the single source of truth for task planning and memory.
You create another list of tasks in the file right after I explicitly confirm their content in the chat context window.

## Memory handling

1. Treat tasks with `[x]` as **completed memory** – never propose them again.  
2. Keep the original wording of memory tasks intact when referencing them.

## Session planning

When the user requests a new work session **or** no unchecked tasks remain:

1. Insert a new section at the **bottom** of the file with the next task session number.
2. Determine `<nextIndex>` = last index + 1.

  ```markdown

  ## Step <nextIndex>

  - [ ] 1. **<Title>** – <brief description>
  - [ ] 2. **…**
  - [ ] 3. **…**

  ---

  ```

3. Generate exactly three top‑level tasks; each ≤ 6 words, description ≤ 100 chars.
4. Optional: nest Markdown subtasks (  - [ ] …) if a step genuinely needs internal checklist.

## Progress tracking

* After finishing a task, immediately:
  * Change its box to [x].
  * Commit or explain the code that solved it.
* Never modify earlier completed sections other than checkbox flips.

## Formatting rules

* Pure Markdown only – no HTML, no code fences in task list.
* Preserve ordering; do not reorder tasks automatically.
* Repair malformed checklists or merge conflicts before continuing.

## Safety & limits

* If adding a section would exceed 300 lines, prompt the user to archive old memory.
* Abort and ask for help if the task file becomes unreadable.
